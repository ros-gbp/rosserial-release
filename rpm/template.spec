%description
rosserial_xbee provides tools to do point to multipoint communication between
rosserial nodes connected to an xbee. All of the nodes communicate back to a
master xbee connected to a computer running ROS. This software currently only
works with Series 1 Xbees. This pkg includes python code from the python-xbee
project: http://code.google.com/p/python-xbee/

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
